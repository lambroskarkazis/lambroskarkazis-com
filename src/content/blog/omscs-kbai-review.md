For the Fall of 2025 - I took <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7637-knowledge-based-artificial-intelligence-cognitive-systems">Knowledge-Based AI (KBAI)</a>

I wanted to take this class since it is taught by <a href="https://www.davidjoyner.net/">Dr David Joyner</a>. He was one of the earliest people involved with starting the OMSCS program, and one of the few professors still involved since the beginning over a decade ago.

The course focused (fairly abstractly) on the architecture of AI agents. The lectures discussed semantic networks, planning, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soar_(cognitive_architecture)">SOAR Architecture</a>, and other topics.

There were alot of assignments, projects, and reports due throughout the class. The most interesting was the semester project. We worked on a program which can solve a subset of problems in the <a href="https://arcprize.org/">ARC AGI Challenge</a>. This is a series of visual puzzles which humans do fairly well at (a human panel gets >98%) and current LLMs and statistically based Machine Learning methods don't (for instance Deepseek R1 gets around 15%). Here is the <a href="https://arcprize.org/leaderboard">leaderboard</a>. While my end result was not groundbreaking, it was very interesting following along and reading about new state of the art models as they came out.

Ultimately - and ironically - those statistical models performed better and better as the semester went on. <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-deep-think/">Gemini 3 Deep Think</a> got 87.5% right on ARC-AGI-1 (which we were focusing on during the class).

This class has made me more excited to move forwards with the statistical machine learning classes (e.g. <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7641-machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>, <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7642-reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement Learning</a>, and <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7643-deep-learning">Deep Learning</a>) since that really seems to be where meaningful research progress will continue to be made.
